Ardour Scene Manager
==================

This program adds scene managament to Ardour externally so
that different mixes from the same session can be interchanged
at the click of a button. 

The program takes advantage of MIDI binding maps so that it can listen
to Ardour's MIDI control port to keep track of track level changes. The user
can then load a saved mix in to Ardour with it's MIDI control input and have
the saved track levels loaded again.


This program is distributed in the hope that you might find it useful.

If you want to do some work on it or want to get in touch you can get hold of me here:
